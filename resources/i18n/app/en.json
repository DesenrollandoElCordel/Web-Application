        "para2": "Nearly 60 % of the sheets preserved in Geneva (539 out of 915) were published between the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 20th century, and come from the main Spanish printing centres: Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Palma de Mallorca and Seville. Many of them are written in Catalan.",
        "para3": "The engravings that illustrate the leaves have been extracted one by one in order to compose this catalogue of images, which allows a search by key words and a comparison of motifs. Only the engravings on the sheets printed by José María Moreno are included here; in the near future they will be joined by the rest of the images in the Geneva collection."

        "para1": "As is well known, the dawn of European printing was marked by the appearance of prestigious works, such as Johannes Gutenberg's Bible (c. 1400-1468). However, from the very beginning, there was also a demand - and a significant production - for works accessible to all social classes, including the less educated and less fortunate. In order to satisfy this demand and to produce documents massively, quickly and cheaply, ingenious manufacturing techniques were used, such as the reuse of materials and the use of low-quality paper. Unlike books, which were luxury objects intended for a cultured elite, these \"by-products\" of printing were characterised by their fragility and the presence of frequent misprints, proof of the scant care taken in their manufacture. Although their contents were very diverse, their appearance varied little: for this reason, we can speak of a genre or editorial format.",
        "para2": "Despite the great diffusion they enjoyed for centuries, these printed documents are paradoxically difficult to study, as many of them have disappeared, while those that have been preserved are scattered, often stored in boxes labelled \"Miscellaneous\". Fortunately, the value of this \"popular literature\", long undervalued for its low quality due to its production process, style and content, is now recognised.",
        "para3": "The research project \"Desenrollando el cordel / Démêler le cordel / Untangling the cordel\" (2020-2023) of the University of Geneva is part of this trend of promotion and revaluation of cordel literature thanks to which, in recent years, numerous digital libraries have appeared. This website allows the visitor to explore the University of Geneva's collection of cordel sheets, to carry out thematic or text searches, to compare the digitised images and their transcriptions with other copies, or simply to take a closer look at the illustrations that adorn these documents."

The project aims to digitise, study and enhance the value of the collection of Spanish cordel literature held at the University Library of Geneva. This collection comprises of 915 sheets of cordel, mainly dating from the 19th century and coming from several printing workshops in various cities on the Iberian Peninsula.",
        "para2": "The project's first objective was to put the collection online and describe it in a digital library that provides access not only to the documents but also to an enriched and searchable transcription of the texts. Secondly, starting from this digitized corpus, this project aims to develop several specific research objectives with the help of digital technologies. These include the study of these texts from a literary point of view, the analysis of the colophons as a dating method and the study of the woodcuts that decorate the sheets. Far from being a purely decorative element, they constitute a valuable resource for a better understanding of the work of the printers, the interests and imaginary of their public, and the dissemination and reuse of the same images among the printing workshops.",
        "para3": "The team members are Constance Carta (assistant professor), Luana Bermúdez and Belinda Palacios (scientific collaborators), Elina Leblanc (postdoctoral fellow in digital humanities) and Pauline Jacsont (scientific collaborator in digital humanities)."
